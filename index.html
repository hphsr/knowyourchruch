              One of the biggest movements that is leading people straight to hell is called the "prosperoty gospel". Also known as the 
              "word of faith" movement. Catch phrases like "Name it and claim it", "Live your best life now", and "Living the blessed life"
              are drawing people in by the thousands. Why this is so dangerous is that "pastors" have their congregation believing that 
              Jesus came to make you wealthy,while they get wealty off of your tithes. They claim that we're never suppsoed to experience 
              any health, financial, or relational problems. Anything less than "your best life now" is a direct result of your lack of 
              giving. I always ask; werethe apostles living their best life now while they were being stoned to death, burned at the steak,
              crucified upside down,and sawed in half? Absoultly not! They died for the gospel, the true gospel of Jesus Christ. In fact, 
              scripture tells us quite the opposite. It says that when we become Christians, we will be persecuted and hated for our faith 
              in Jesus. Were told we're sexist, homophobic, intollerant, bigotted, ignorant of the truth and that we're just down right 
              malicious people. If our relationship with the world is one of disdain, we're likely following scriptuere and not the world.

              2 Timothy 4:3 is one of the many scripturs that warns us about false teachers and heretical doctrine. "For the time is coming
              when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit 
              their own passions"

              Here is a group of "pastors" and churches that are dangerous, and need to be avoided at all costs. I have no ill will towards these men and women, I love them in Christ and pray that they turn from their sin, find a Bible believing church, and learn under the teaching of a doctrinally sound teacher of The Word.
