          <p>Churches You Must Avoid!:</p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest movements that is leading people straight to hell is the prosperity gospel spewing, "Name it and claim it", "Live your best life now" churches. Why this is so dangerous is due to "pastors" having their congregation believing that Jesus came to make you wealthy, that we're never suppsoed to experience any health, financial, relational problems or anything less than "your best life now". I always ask; were the apostles living their best life now while they were being stoned to death, burned alive, crucified upside down, and sawed in half? Absoultly not. They died for the gospel, the true gospel of Jesus Christ. In fact, scripture tells us quite the opposite. It says that when we become christians, we will be persecuted and hated for our faith in Jesus. Were told we're intollerant, bigotted, ignorant of the truth and that we're just down right malicious people. If our relationship with the world is one of disdain, we're likely following scriptuer and not the world.

            2 Timothy 4:3 is one of the many scripturs that warns us about false teachers and heretical doctrine. "For the time is coming when peiple will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions"
