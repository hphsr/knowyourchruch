            <p>So many chruches are being led astray by heretical pastors today. I am creating a database where you can find your church, view their statement of faith (what we believe), see whos in charge and find out much more information. I hope this will aide you in finding a church that not only preaches the bible, but does so in a way that upholds doctrinal truth and glorifies God!

          <p>What does your church say about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>God's holiness</li>
              <li>The Trinity</li>
              <li>Marriage</li>
              <li>Homosexuality</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Please take the time to make sure you're being fed right!</p>
          <p>Your salvation may be in jeorpardy.</p>
